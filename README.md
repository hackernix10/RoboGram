## What can you do with this program?
This is an automation script that will log in with your Instagram account and do some promotion work for you. What does it exactly do? It takes hashtags that you give it, seaches for pictures marked with one of those hashtags and likes, comments them or follows their owners. You can set the number of likes, comments and follows your bot should do. You also must choose some hashtags, so that bot can seach posts with them. I would suggest you to take hashtags which describes your own interests and what your account is about.
